        <p style="padding-right: 7rem;">Hack4Impact's e-board struggled with coordination, timing, and planning of events. 
            Financial planning and attendance tracking were fragmented and inconsistent; Used 5 different tools that are not synced altogether;
            Some members would forget about events, and data was spread across spreadsheets with no clear tracking. This made it difficult to see patterns or plan effectively.  <br>
            <br>I led a cross-functional team of two developers to build a full-stack Event Management Platform for Hack4Impact -focused on improving internal coordination, accessible file sharing and easy-to-navigate data visibility through a modern, responsive web app.

        </div>
        <div class="col-content">
            <p>My role served both as the Technical Product Manager and secondary UX Designer, I defined the product vision, worked closely with the engineering team and handled the product design. My role also included the leading of weekly sprint planning, set milestones, gathered async feedback, and served as the translator between tech constraints and operational pain points. 
                I kept the team anchored in solving for clarity, simplicity, and sustainability‚Äînot feature creep.</p>
            <p>I also conducted stakeholder interviews with student leaders across other Hack4Impact chapters to benchmark internal tooling best practices. This helped frame our solution not just as an internal fix, but as a potential future product template across campuses.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion & Reflections</h2>
    <p>This project helped me grow as a product thinker and collaborator. I learned how to scope MVPs realistically, communicate across disciplines, and prioritize ruthlessly. Most importantly, I saw firsthand how student teams can build meaningful, real-world software for social good.</p>
