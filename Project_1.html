                <h2> A Shared Problem and Our Statement</h2>
                    <p>
                    If you are an International Student studying in the United States, there is a good chance that you've heard of CPT/ OPT Sponsorship Work Authorization. Basically, it's your ticket to working legally here in the United States outside campus.
                    And I'm sure that if you've ever used Handshake, LinkedIn or even Indeed, you can see the numbers of opportunities in store for you dropped significantly with those filters on! And if you accidentally applied to one who doesn't sponsor, applications become worthless and job searching is mundane!
                    </p>
                <p>
                    That's when the bulb lit up. What if right off the bat, there is a simpler and much faster way? Opportunities that paves way for a lot of hungry and passion-driven students without the fret of sponsorship problems! 
                    <br>
                    <h2 style="color: orange; font-size: 20px;">There is a need for international students with little to no experience
                    to gain more opportunities in order to get
                    better job employment chances and overall success!</h2>

                <h2>Features and Applications</h2>
                <p>
                The nature of the application is to be used as a job board platform
                that students can use to apply for volunteer & internship roles in 
                Nonprofits Sector or Social Organizations within Boston.
                    <br>
                Thus, the idea is that we want to make a webapp.

                    <p>
                    Utilizing both PostgreSQL & React, we created a login page for both User Authentication 
                    & New User Login Page for Users to make their own session
                    </p>

                <p>
                    To get a better understanding of the UI/UX that comes into play for the users, 
                    we created a Figma Board that details the User Journey and UI elements 
                    for further feedback from Potential Users
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a part of the project, we created a Pitch Presentation that further emphasizes the 
                    future of the application and the Management aspect of the Webapp
